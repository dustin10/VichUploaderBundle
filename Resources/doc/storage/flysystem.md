Flysystem
=========

> Flysystem is a filesystem abstraction which allows you to easily swap out a
> local filesystem for a remote one.


## Configuration

Here is a sample configuration that stores your file in your local filesystem,
but you can use your preferred adapters and FS (for details on this topic you
should refer to [the official documentation](https://github.com/1up-lab/OneupFlysystemBundle/blob/master/Resources/doc/index.md)).

``` yaml
oneup_flysystem:
    adapters:
        product_adapter:
            local:
                directory: '%kernel.project_dir%/public/images/products'

    filesystems:
        product_image_fs:
            adapter: product_adapter
            mount: product_image_fs

vich_uploader:
    db_driver: orm
    storage: flysystem

    mappings:
        product_image:
            uri_prefix: /images/products
            upload_destination: product_image_fs
```

Even when using `flysystem` as the storage engine you can still use
the same mappings options that you would use with default storage.

**Note:**

> In this case `upload_destination` refers to a Flysystem FS.

**Note:**

> [OneupFlysystemBundle](https://github.com/1up-lab/OneupFlysystemBundle) needs
> to be installed and activated to get the FlysystemStorage to work.
