Known issues
============

## Annotations don't work with Propel

When Propel is the chosen database driver, the "uploadable" entities must be
known when the service container is built. As there is no way to retrieve all
annotated entities, the only workaround is to define mappings using Yaml or XML.

## Image not deleted with cascade deletion and Doctrine

Just check the following options: ```cascade={"remove"}``` and ```orphanRemoval=true```.

```yaml
Vendor\Bundle\CoolBundle\Entity\CoolEntity:
    type:   entity

    fields: ...

    oneToMany:
        images:
           targetEntity:   CoolEntityImage
           mappedBy:       bike
           cascade:        [persist, merge, remove]
           orphanRemoval:  true
```

## No Upload is triggered when manually injecting an instance of Symfony\Component\HttpFoundation\File\File

An upload will only be triggered if an instance of `Symfony\Component\HttpFoundation\File\UploadedFile`
is injected into the setter for the `Vich\UploadableField` property of your class. Normally this is done
automatically if using Symfony Form but if your application logic is attempting to do this manually and you
inject an instance of `Symfony\Component\HttpFoundation\File\File` *instead* the bundle will silently ignore
your attempted upload.
Consider the following class:

``` php
<?php

namespace Acme\DemoBundle\Entity;

use Doctrine\ORM\Mapping as ORM;
use Symfony\Component\HttpFoundation\File\File;
use Vich\UploaderBundle\Mapping\Annotation as Vich;

/**
 * @ORM\Entity
 * @Vich\Uploadable
 */
class Product
{
    /**
     * @Vich\UploadableField(mapping="product_image", fileNameProperty="imageName")
     *
     * @var File
     */
    private $image;

    /**
     * If manually uploading a file (i.e. not using Symfony Form) ensure an instance
     * of 'UploadedFile' is injected into this setter to trigger the  update. If this
     * bundle's configuration parameter 'inject_on_load' is set to 'true' this setter
     * must be able to accept an instance of 'File' as the bundle will inject one here
     * during Doctrine hydration.
     *
     * @param File $image
     */
    public function setImage(File $image = null)
    {
        $this->image = $image;
    }
}
```

If the bundle's configuration parameter `inject_on_load` is set to `true` the `Product::setImage()`
method above must take an instance of `File` as when this class is hydrated by Doctrine this
bundle will automatically inject an instance of `File` there. However if you were to change
the image path to a new image in that instance of `File` and attempted a `flush()` nothing
would happen, instead inject a new instance of `UploadedFile` with the new path to your new
image to sucessfully trigger the upload.

**N.B** : UploadedFile objects have a [*test* mode](http://api.symfony.com/2.8/Symfony/Component/HttpFoundation/File/UploadedFile.html#method___construct) that can be used to simulate file uploads.

## Failed to set metadata before uploading the file

When using Gaufrette with some specific adapters, it's possible that metadata can't be set when uploading a file.
For some adapters, metadata need to be defined after the upload because setting the metadata for a given file results in a separate API call. In the other hand, for other adapters setting the metadata does not result in an API call: the metadata is joined with the file during the upload.
To summarize, [Gaufrette support for metadata is flawed](https://github.com/KnpLabs/Gaufrette/issues/108) (see issue [GH-163](https://github.com/dustin10/VichUploaderBundle/issues/163)).
