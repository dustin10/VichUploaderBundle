VichUploaderBundle
==================

The VichUploaderBundle is a Symfony2 bundle that attempts to ease file
uploads that are attached to an entity. The bundle will automatically name and
save the uploaded file according to the configuration specified on a per property
basis using a mix of configuration and annotations. After the entity has been created
and the file has been saved, if configured to do so an instance of
`Symfony\Component\HttpFoundation\File\File` will be loaded into the annotated property
when the entity is loaded from the datastore. The bundle also provides templating helpers
for generating URLs to the file. The file can also be configured to be removed from the
file system upon removal of the entity.

## Installation

### Get the bundle

To install the bundle, place it in the `vendor/bundles/Vich/UploaderBundle`
directory of your project. You can do this by adding the bundle to your deps file,
as a submodule, cloning it, or simply downloading the source.

Add to `deps` file:

```
[gaufrette]
    git=http://github.com/KnpLabs/Gaufrette.git

[KnpGaufretteBundle]
    git=http://github.com/KnpLabs/KnpGaufretteBundle.git
    target=/bundles/Knp/Bundle/GaufretteBundle

[VichUploaderBundle]
    git=git://github.com/dustin10/VichUploaderBundle.git
    target=/bundles/Vich/UploaderBundle
```

Or you may add the bundle as a git submodule:

``` bash
$ git submodule add https://github.com/dustin10/VichUploaderBundle.git vendor/bundles/Vich/UploaderBundle
```

### Add the namespace to your autoloader

Next you should add the `Vich` namespace to your autoloader:

``` php
<?php
// app/autoload.php

$loader->registerNamespaces(array(
    // ...
    'Knp\Bundle'                => __DIR__.'/../vendor/bundles',
    'Gaufrette'                 => __DIR__.'/../vendor/gaufrette/src',
    'Vich' => __DIR__.'/../vendor/bundles'
));
```

### Initialize the bundle

To start using the bundle, register the bundle in your application's kernel class:

``` php
// app/AppKernel.php
public function registerBundles()
{
    $bundles = array(
        // ...
        new Knp\Bundle\GaufretteBundle\KnpGaufretteBundle(),
        new Vich\UploaderBundle\VichUploaderBundle(),
    );
)
```

### Configuration

First configure the `db_driver` option. You must specify either `orm` or
`mongodb`.

``` yaml
# app/config/config.yml
vich_uploader:
    db_driver: orm # or mongodb
```

In order to map configuration options to the property of the entity you first
need to create a mapping in the bundle configuration. You create these mappings
under the `mappings` key. Each mapping should have a unique name. So, if you wanted
to name your mapping `product_image`, the configuration for this mapping would be
similar to:

``` yaml
knp_gaufrette:
    adapters:
        product_adapter:
            local:
                directory: %kernel.root_dir%/../web/images/products

    filesystems:
        product_image_fs:
            adapter:    product_adapter

vich_uploader:
    db_driver: orm
    mappings:
        product_image:
            uri_prefix: /images/products
            upload_destination: product_image_fs
```

The `upload_destination` is the only required configuration option for an entity mapping.
All options are listed below:

- `upload_destination`: The gaufrette fs id to upload the file to
- `namer`: The id of the file namer service for this entity (See Namers section below)
- `directory_namer`: The id of the directory namer service for this entity (See Namers section below)
- `delete_on_remove`: Set to true if the file should be deleted from the
filesystem when the entity is removed
- `inject_on_load`: Set to true if the file should be injected into the uploadable
field property when it is loaded from the data store. The object will be an instance
of `Symfony\Component\HttpFoundation\File\File`

**Note:**

> A verbose configuration reference including all configuration options and their
> default values is included at the bottom of this document.

## Annotate Entities

In order for your entity or document to work with the bundle, you need to add a
few annotations to it. First, annotate your class with the `Uploadable` annotation.
This lets the bundle know that it should look for files to upload in your class when
it is saved, inject the files when it is loaded and check to see if it needs to
remove files when it is removed. Next, you should annotate the fields which hold
the instance of `Symfony\Component\HttpFoundation\File\UploadedFile` when the form
is submitted with the `UploadableField` annotation. The `UploadableField` annotation
has a few required options. They are as follows:

- `mapping`: The mapping specified in the bundle configuration to use
- `fileNameProperty`: The property of the class that will be filled with the file name
generated by the bundle

Lets look at an example using a fictional `Product` ORM entity:

``` php
<?php

namespace Acme\DemoBundle\Entity;

use Doctrine\ORM\Mapping as ORM;
use Symfony\Component\Validator\Constraints as Assert;
use Vich\UploaderBundle\Mapping\Annotation as Vich;

/**
 * @ORM\Entity
 * @Vich\Uploadable
 */
class Product
{
    /**
     * @ORM\Id
     * @ORM\Column(type="integer")
     * @ORM\GeneratedValue(strategy="AUTO")
     */
    protected $id;

    // ..... other fields

    /**
     * @Assert\File(
     *     maxSize="1M",
     *     mimeTypes={"image/png", "image/jpeg", "image/pjpeg"}
     * )
     * @Vich\UploadableField(mapping="property_image", fileNameProperty="imageName")
     *
     * @var File $image
     */
    protected $image;

    /**
     * @ORM\Column(type="string", length=255, name="image_name")
     *
     * @var string $imageName
     */
    protected $imageName;
}
```

## Namers

The bundle uses namers to name the files and directories it saves to the filesystem. A namer
implements the `Vich\UploaderBundle\Naming\NamerInterface` interface. If no namer is
configured for a mapping, the bundle will simply use the name of the file that
was uploaded. if you would like to change this then you must implement a custom namer.

### File Namer

To create a custom file namer, simply implement the `Vich\UploaderBundle\Naming\NamerInterface`
and in the `name` method of your class return the desired file name. Since your entity
is passed to the `name` method, as well as the field name, you are free to get any information
from it to create the name, or inject any other services that you require.

> **Note**: The name returned should include the file extension as well. This can easily
> be retrieved from the `UploadedFile` instance using the `getExtension` or `guessExtension`
> depending on what version of PHP you are running.

After you have created your namer and configured it as a service, you simply specify
the service id for the `namer` configuration option of your mapping. An example:

``` yaml
vich_uploader:
    # ...
    mappings:
        product_image:
            upload_destination: product_image
            namer: my.namer.product
```

Here `my.namer.product` is the configured id of the service.

If no namer is configured for a mapping, the bundle will simply use the name of the file that
was uploaded.

### Directory Namer

To create a custom directory namer, simply implement the `Vich\UploaderBundle\Naming\DirectoryNamerInterface`
and in the `directoryName` method of your class return the absolute directory. Since your entity, field name
and default `upload_destination` are all passed to the `directoryName` method you are free to get any information
from it to create the name, or inject any other services that you require.

After you have created your directory namer and configured it as a service, you simply specify
the service id for the `directory_namer` configuration option of your mapping. An example:

``` yaml
vich_uploader:
    # ...
    mappings:
        product_image:
            upload_destination: product_image
            directory_namer: my.directory_namer.product
```

If no directory namer is configured for a mapping, the bundle will simply use the `upload_destination` configuration option.

## Generating URLs

To get a url for the file you can use the `vich_uploader.templating.helper`
service as follows:

``` php
$entity = // get the entity..
$helper = $this->container->get('vich_uploader.templating.helper.uploader_helper');
$path = $helper->asset($entity, 'image');
```
or in a Twig template you can use the `vich_uploader_asset` function:

``` twig
<img src="{{ vich_uploader_asset(product, 'image') }}" alt="{{ product.name }}" />
```

You must specify the annotated property you wish to get the file path for.

> **Note:** The path returned is relative to the web directory which is specified
> using the `uri_prefix` configuration parameter.

## Configuration Reference

Below is the full default coniguration for the bundle:

``` yaml
# app/config/config.yml
vich_uploader:
    db_driver: orm # or mongodb
    twig: true
    mappings:
        product_image:
            uri_prefix: /images # uri prefix to resource
            upload_destination: ~ # gaufrette storage fs id, required
            namer: ~ # specify a file namer service id for this entity, null default
            directory_namer: ~ # specify a directory namer service id for this entity, null default
            delete_on_remove: true # determines whether to delete file upon removal of entity
            inject_on_load: true # determines whether to inject a File instance upon load
        # ... more mappings
```
