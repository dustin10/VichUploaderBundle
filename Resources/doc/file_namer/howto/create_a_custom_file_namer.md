Create a custom file namer
==========================

To create a custom file namer, simply implement the `Vich\UploaderBundle\Naming\NamerInterface`
and in the `name` method of your class return the desired file name. Since your entity
is passed to the `name` method, as well as the mapping describing it, you are
free to get any information from it to create the name, or inject any other
service you require.

**Note**:

> The name returned should include the file extension as well. This can easily
> be retrieved from the `UploadedFile` instance using the `getExtension` or `guessExtension`
> depending on what version of PHP you are running.

After you have created your namer and configured it as a service, you simply specify
the service for the `namer` configuration option of your mapping. An example:

``` yaml
vich_uploader:
    # ...
    mappings:
        product_image:
            upload_destination: product_image
            namer: App\Naming\MyNamer
```

Where `App\Naming\MyNamer` is the configured service class.

**Note**:

> The namer service must be public.
> If you're using default configuration, make sure to explicit public visibility
> for your namer service


## That was it!
