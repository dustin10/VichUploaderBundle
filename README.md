VichUploaderBundle
==================

[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/dustin10/VichUploaderBundle.png?branch=master)](http://travis-ci.org/dustin10/VichUploaderBundle)

The VichUploaderBundle is a Symfony2 bundle that attempts to ease file
uploads that are attached to ORM entities or ODM documents.

- Automatically name and save a file to a configured directory
- Inject the file back into the entity or document when it is loaded from the datastore as an
instance of `Symfony\Component\HttpFoundation\File\File`
- Delete the file from the file system upon removal of the entity or document from the datastore
- Templating helpers to generate public URLs to the file

All of this functionality is fully configurable to allow for app-specific customization.

Current limitations:

- Saving/deleting files to the local filesystem only
