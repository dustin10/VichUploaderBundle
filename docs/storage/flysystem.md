# Flysystem

> Flysystem is a filesystem abstraction library for PHP. It provides an abstraction
> for the filesystem in order to change the storage backend depending on the execution
> environment (local files in development, cloud storage in production and memory in tests)
> and your configuration.

[Read the official library documentation](https://flysystem.thephpleague.com)

VichUploaderBundle can use Flysystem as a storage engine by relying on one of two bundles:
[thephpleague/flysystem-bundle](https://github.com/thephpleague/flysystem-bundle)
or
[oneup/flysystem-bundle](https://github.com/1up-lab/OneupFlysystemBundle).

**Note:**

> When using `flysystem` as the storage engine, you can still use
> the same mappings options that you would use with default storage.

## Integrating with [thephpleague/flysystem-bundle](https://github.com/thephpleague/flysystem-bundle)

To install the bundle, run the following command:

```bash
composer require league/flysystem-bundle
```

It will create a default YAML configuration using Symfony Flex:

```yaml
# config/packages/flysystem.yaml

flysystem:
    storages:
        default.storage:
            adapter: 'local'
            options:
                directory: '%kernel.project_dir%/var/storage/default'
```

You can adapt this configuration to your needs by reading the
[bundle documentation](https://github.com/thephpleague/flysystem-bundle/blob/master/docs/1-getting-started.md).

Once you have a storage ready, you can use it in your VichUploaderBundle configuration:

``` yaml
vich_uploader:
    db_driver: orm
    storage: flysystem

    mappings:
        products:
            uri_prefix: /images/products
            upload_destination: default.storage # Use the name you defined for your storage here
```

### Issues with adapters public url

If you are using certain adapters like S3, Cloudflare, etc., the generated public URL for assets may be incorrect.
To resolve this, you can create your own
[custom storage](https://github.com/dustin10/VichUploaderBundle/blob/master/docs/storage/custom.md)
by duplicating the existing FlysystemStorage and adding this function:

```php
    public function resolveUri(object|array $obj, ?string $fieldName = null, ?string $className = null): ?string
    {
        $path = $this->resolvePath($obj, $fieldName, $className, true);

        if (empty($path)) {
            return null;
        }

        $mapping = null === $fieldName ?
            $this->factory->fromFirstField($obj, $className) :
            $this->factory->fromField($obj, $fieldName, $className);
        $fs = $this->getFilesystem($mapping);

        try {
            return $fs->publicUrl($path);
        } catch (FilesystemException) {
            return $mapping->getUriPrefix().'/'.$path;
        }
    }
```

Be careful with that; if you have existing implementations,
it can break them. See [there](https://github.com/dustin10/VichUploaderBundle/pull/1441).

## Integrating with [oneup/flysystem-bundle](https://github.com/1up-lab/OneupFlysystemBundle)

To install the bundle, run the following command:

```bash
composer require oneup/flysystem-bundle
```

Here is a sample configuration that stores your file in your local filesystem,
but you can use your preferred adapters and FS (for details on this topic you
should refer to
[the bundle documentation](https://github.com/1up-lab/OneupFlysystemBundle/blob/master/doc/index.md)).

``` yaml
oneup_flysystem:
    adapters:
        product_adapter:
            local:
                location: '%kernel.project_dir%/public/images/products'

    filesystems:
        products:
            adapter: product_adapter
            mount: products

vich_uploader:
    db_driver: orm
    storage: flysystem

    mappings:
        products:
            uri_prefix: /images/products
            # For Oneup/FlysystemBundle v4
            upload_destination: oneup_flysystem.products_filesystem
            # For Oneup/FlysystemBundle v3
            # upload_destination: products
```

## That was it!
